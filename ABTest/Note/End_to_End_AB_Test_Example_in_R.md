## 1. Example

Decco is an online retailer taht sells home decor items. They recently added 'Lamps' as a new category of products which they were not selling before. In order to generate awareness and boost sales, they want to do a promotion through their App. Their notifications have had good success in the past and they are considering a $10 discount through in-app notification. But at the same time, they want to be judicious about any features or releases when it comes to their app because they know that the LTV of a customer who has installed their app is much higher. They want to be careful so as not to drive users to uninstall the app.

## 2. Questions

    A. Can they run an A/B test in this scenario?

    -> Yes, they can. In fact, given that they are worried about driving uninstall and there is a cost involved there - it makes sense for them to first do an A/B test to see what the expected conversion and uninstall rate will be.

    B. What is the business hypothesis?

    -> Because we have seen good success through in-app notifications in the past, if we send an in-app notification with a promotional offer for Lamps, then the % of users that purchase from the Lamp Category will increase.

    Primary Metric - Transaction Rate 
    - i.e. % of users that will make a purchase
    Secondary Metric - Purchase Value
    Other Metric - Uninstall Rate
