### I. In order for your code to support AB Test, you need two things.

1. you need a mechanism to provide either the A or B variety.
2. you need to define KPIs and a mechanism to report them.

### II. Feature Flags

A common mechanism to provide the A and B varieties is by using a feature flag.

Feature flag is basically nothing more than Boolean value that you can set to true or false and depending on that value. 

You go to display or do something different in your application.

For example, suppose you want to check whether that save button is actually used by any of the users of warsbad.

If there are any in order to test that, you need to be able to enable or disable the save button. 

So some users will see it and other users won't.
