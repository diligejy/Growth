    - How many times on average did users stream Taylor Swift's new song on release day?

### Scenario : How are AmpliTunes users engaging with the new Community feature?

Metrics I'm Tracking:
- Proportion of weekly active users triggering a community event.
- Which community event is triggered most often?
