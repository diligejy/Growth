## 1. Problem

We don't have a lot of existing CPO out there.

So we have a first-time cpo.

What is role of CPO?

## 2. The role of CPO

"The role of the CPO is essentially the same as being a product manager. You are the intersection of the user and the business but the stakes are much higher."

- Georgie Smallwood, CPO of Tier Mobility.

## 3. Pitfalls 1 -  Not Speaking the language

One common thing that I hear from new chief product officers all the time "My executives just don't get it."

What is the language of executives?

They want to know how do you make money?

You need to be able to talk about how the business makes money.

"If you don't know what are the most important outcomes for the business then you have to get smart on that.

If you do, then you have to be able to identify and execute a strategy to get to that outcome."

- Gijo Mathew, CPO of VTS

We are reaching business outcomes through solving customer problems.

### <b>Product Strategy</b>

    A framework that enables teams to make product decisions about how to provide customer value which in turn drives business value.

## 4. Pitfalls 2 - Not spending Product Strategy.

### Strategy Deployment

1. Vision
    - What do we want to be in 5-10 years? Value for customers, position in market, What our business looks like?
    - CEO / Senior Leadership

2. Strategic Intent
    - What business challenges are standing in our way of reaching our vision?
    - Senior Leadership / Business Leads

3. Product Initiative
    - What problems can we address to tackle the challenge from a product perspective?
    - Product Leadership Team (Directors & VPs under a CPO)

4. Options
    - What are the different ways I can address that problem to reach my goal?
    - Product Teams (Product Managers)

## 5. Pitfall 3 - Not setting up the systems and people to scale

We want to make sure that we can answer these questions after we have teams. 

- Which products and segments are the most profitable?
- Which products have the most sales debt?
- Which features are driving sales and adoption by segment?
- Which customer segments have the best retention?
- Which products have the most time invested in bug fixed?

<b>Product Operations</b>

1. Business Data & Insights
    - Collection and analysis of internal data for strategy creation and monitoring

2. Customer & Market Insights
    - Facilitation and aggrgation of external research

3. Process and Practices
    - Scaling PM value with consistent cross functional practices and frameworks.

## 6. Pitfall 4 - Not remembering your first team is your executive team

What happens is they forget that they're part of the executive team?

And you know what happens the executive team conspires against him and kicks him out.

So you want to make sure that you are part of this team.

Sales is now your best friend.

"Stay humble. Listen and ask questions.

It's not about winning the battle. Have the self-confidence and awareness of what success really is for you."

- Brian Bhuta, CPO of Forsta

## 7. Pitfall 5 - Not being in the right situation for your skillset

Your context here is king about which of these people you actually want.
