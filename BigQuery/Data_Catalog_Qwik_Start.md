## 2. Using Data Catalog

There are two main ways you interact with Data Catalog:

- Searching for data assets that you have access to.

- Tagging assets with metadata.

## 3. Data Catalog use case


Imagine you are a data engineer in your company. It is your job to ensure all datasets can be easily discovered and used by colleagues, such as data scientists or business analysts. When a new dataset comes in, you annotate it with important informationâ€”this could be whether or not it contains PII data, who owns the dataset, how many rows the dataset contains, etc.

You can annotate this information by adding tags to your dataset and tables. Data Catalog allows you to create tag templates to let you define what kind of attributes you want to tag. This allows you to easily access, map, and discover pertinent information from your datasets and tables.
