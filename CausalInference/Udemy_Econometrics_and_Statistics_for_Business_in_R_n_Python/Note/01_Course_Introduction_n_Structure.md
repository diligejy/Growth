## 1. [Smoke & Parkinson](https://www.neurologyadvisor.com/topics/movement-disorders/the-troubling-link-between-parkinsons-and-smoking-can-we-deny-the-benefits/)

1. Facts and Questions

    - The incidence of Parkinson's in people between 55 and 75 is twice as significant in non-smokers as in smokers.
    - Now, does it mean there is a causal relationship between smoking and being Parkinson's free?

    
2. The facts we should know

    - People are more likely to get Parkinson's the older they get to the smokers.
    - Smokers life expectancy is lower than non-smokers.
    - Hence, the smoker group doesn't leave as much as the non-smoker one and is thus less likely to reach an age they can get Parkinson's.
    - In other words, non smokers are more likely to have Parkinson's because they live longer and not because they don't smoke.
    - The argument is victim of not having two comparable groups.
    - There is a disease that correlates with age and two groups that have different life expectancies.
    - We are facing a selection bias here.
    - To overcome this, we will learn propensity score matching, which will transform non comparable groups into similar ones.
    - Omitted variable bias, mutual causality and selection bias are the primary bias we will tackle.
