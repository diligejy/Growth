### 3-1 Exemplary answers

#### Example 1

The last weeks, we have been very busy on the project. First, I talked to Tom from Finance to get the market data.

However, when looking at the numbers we realized that Marketing has the better numbers. With the new Marketing data set, together with interviews we conducted, we were able to get a good overview of the different market opportunities.

At the moment, it looks like France would be a good fit for our project, though this is still work in progress.

#### Example 2

Our current hypothesis is, that France would be the best fit for our project. This is based on 3 reasons:

First, consumer research shows that French consumers will appreciate our offering

Second, the competitive landscape in France is not yet developed, we will be the first with this offering.

Third, our logistics and distribution capabilities are well set up to serve the French market.
