## 1. Strategic Planning is not for strategy

- Strategy != Planning

- What most strategic planning is in the world of business has nothing todo with strategy.

## 2. What is Strategy?

- Strategy is an integrative set of choices that positions you on a playing field of your choice in a way that you win.

- A strategic theory must be coherent and doable

## 3. Why do leaders often do so much planning?

- Planning is quite comforting

- Planning
    - You control costs
    - You are the customer
    - It's comfortable

- Strategy
    - Actual customers are the customers
    - You don't control them
    - You don't control revenues.
    
## 4. How do I avoid the "planning trap"?

- Accept angst
    - It'll make you feel somewhat nervous. Because as a manager, chances are you've been taught you should do things that you can prove in advance.
    - You can't prove in advance that your strategy will succeed.

- Lay out the logic. Then tweak.
- Keep it short - ideally 1 page
