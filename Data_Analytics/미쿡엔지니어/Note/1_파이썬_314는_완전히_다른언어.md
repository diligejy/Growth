## 1. What's new on Python 3.14

- Deferred Evaluation of Annotations
- Template string literals (t-strings)
- Zstandard compression format
- Improved error messages
- Free-Threaded mode improvements

## 2. Deferred evaluation of annotations

- Previously, if you used a forward reference in a type annotation, you'd often have to wrap it in a string or use from __future__ import annotations.
- In Python 3.14, the annotation expression evaluation is deferred, and you can inspect it via the new annotationlib module.

## 3. Template String Literals (t-strings)

- The new t'...' (or t"...") prefix creates a Template object rather than a plain str, allowing introspection of the static vs. interpolated parts.

## 4. Zstandard support via compression.zstd

- You can now use the compression.zstd module to compress/decompress data in the Zstandard format.

## 5. Improved Error Messages

- For example, if you mistype a keyword like whille instead of while, Python 3.14 will suggest the correct keyword.

## 6. Free-Threaded Mode Improvements

- Free-threaded mode referes to a build/configuration of CPython when the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is disabled (as described in PEP 703).
- In Python 3.14, this mode has received significant improvements
    - On single-threaded workloads under this mode, the performance overhead (compared to a normal GIL-enalbled build) is now roughly 5-10%, depending on platform/compiler(previously 3.12 - 30~60% slower)
