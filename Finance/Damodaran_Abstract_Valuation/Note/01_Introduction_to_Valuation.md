## 1. Why we do valuation

- Lemmings
    - Valuation gives you a life vest. It gives you something to hold on to when everybody else changes their mind and goes in the other direction.
    - Valuation slows the process down, gives your rational side a chance to mount an argument.
    - When I see a valuation cross my desk, before I look at numbers and the assumptions as to questions, "Who did this valuation?", "Who paid them to do this valuation?". Because your biases are going to be preset by what your mission.
    - If you're an investment banker and I come to you for a valuation of a target company and I really want to take over the target company, Remember! your mission is to get the deal done. You're going to find a way to justify that value. Not surprisingly your valuation deliver exactly the result I hope to see that this company is a bargain.

- Sciences
    - Don't be deceived. 
    - Even though you might be using numbers, those numbers are estimates. And when you think about those estimates, those estimates going to come with a great deal of uncertainty and uncertainty scares people.
    - So when you do evaluation one of the tests, you ask your service. "Am I comfortable?", "Am I certain about these numbers?" and especially if we come from a quantitative background, you can look at those numbers and say well "I am really uncomfortable these numbers could be wrong."
    - Well, guess what, they're always going to be wrong because you're forecasting the future and one of the great ironies in valuation is the more uncomfortable you feel valuing a company, the greater the payoff to doing evaluation. That sounds strange strange.

- Big Models
    - As you look at valuations, one of the first things you should try to do is be parsimonious. 
    - If you can value a company with three inputs, don't go looking for five.
    - If you can value a company with three years of forecasts, don't do ten.
    - Less is more.

- Every one of these approaches makes an assumption about market mistakes but they all make different assumptions about how market makes mistakes and how those mistakes get correct.
