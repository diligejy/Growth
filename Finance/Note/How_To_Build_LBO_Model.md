## 1. What is an LBO?


### Interview Answer
AN LBO is a valuation methodology that ultimately measures the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) from purchasing a company funded with cash (sponsor equity) and a significant amount of debt.

A PE firm aims to improve the operational efficiency of the company to generate cash flow that will pay down the debt over time to increase the firm's equity ownership in the company, which is ultimately sold after ~5 years.

### Simple Answer

An LBO is like a house flipper. At the start, you put down a small down payment and fund the rest with a mortgage.

You fix up the house and pay down the mortgage over time with your personal income, which increases your equity ownership and hope the house appreciates over time so you can sell it and earn high returns on your investment.


# 5 Steps of Building LBO

## 1. Transaction Assumptions

- <b>Entry price</b> : total amount company is bought for
- <b>Fees and expences</b> : legal, accounting, bank, and etc
- <b>Debt</b> : tranches of debt with varying interest rates
- <b>Operating Assumptions</b> : Revenue Growth and margins
- <b> Exit Price</b> : Total Amount company is sold for
- <b> Financials</b>: Historical income statement and cash flow figures

Gathering the right assumptions is usually the most time consuming part of building an LBO

## 2. Sources and Uses

Sources = Capital required to fund the deal
- New debt : PE firms usually refinance debt with better interest rates
- Sponsor equity : cash PE firms need to contribute (like a mortgage down payment)

Uses = Capital required to purchase the company
- Fees and expenses - legal, accounting, bank, and etc
- Retiring existing debt - amount PE firm pays off to original loan holders
- Equity payment - amount PE firm pays to existing equity shareholders

Sources must ALWAYS equal Uses

## 3. Levered Free Cash Flow

Net Income

`+` Depreciation & Amortization

`-` Capital Expenditures

`-` Change in Net Working Capital

`-` Mandatory Debt Repayments

`=` Levered Free Cash Flow

Levered Free Cash Flow is used to pay down debt.


## 4. Debt Schedule

What is a debt schedule?

- Because LBOs require so much debt to fund acquisitions, it's important to know how much debtcan be paid off with cash flow
- A debt scehdule (or debt water fall) calculates annual interest and principal payments

Debt Schedule structure

- Beginning Balance
- Interest
- Paydown
- Ending Balance


An debt is paid down, interest expense decreases over time on the income statement.

### Practice - Create Debt Schedule (cont'd)

Assumptions
- Tranche 1 Debt Balance = $1,000
- Levered Free Cash Flow = $50

Tranche 1 Debt Paydown
- Minimum (Levered Free Cash Flow OR Beginning Tranche 1 Debt Balance)
- Minimum ($50, $1,000) = $50

Tranche 2 Debt Paydown
- Minimum (Levered Free Cash Flow OR Levered Free Cash Flow - Tranche 1 Debt Paydown)
- Minimum ($50, $50 - $50)  = $0


## 5. Exit Value and IRR

1. Exit Enterprise Value = Last Year's EBITDA x Exit Multiple
2. Exit Equity Value = Exit Enterprise Value - Net Debt
3. Money Over Invested Capital (MOIC) = Exit Equity Value / Entry Equity Value
4. Internal Rate of Return (IRR) =  MOIC^(1/ # of years) - 1

Most PE firms aim for an IRR > 15% in order to jusify a deal.
