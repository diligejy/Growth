## 1. What is Metric?

Metrics are numbers that we can impact when we change our business processes. So, for example, for a local bricks and mortar retail clothing store rooted in the state of North Carolina. Where we have a 4.75% sales tax, the sales tax is not a metric. There's nothing that we can do to change it. It's basically a fact of nature for us like the weather.

On the other hand the percentage of people who viewed our ad on a particular website. Then used it as a link to click through to our homepage. Can change every time the ad contents and appearance change. Or when the time of day changes, where we run the ad, on what websites it appears etc.

## 2. Distinguishing Revenue, Profitability, and Risk Metrics

All business metrics can be classified into three broad categories. `Revenue metrics, profitability metrics, and risk metrics`.

### Revenue Metrics

Revenue metrics relate to sales and marketing. Profitability metrics to efficiency and logistics, production, and operations. And risk metrics to risk management, and are widely used by a company's creditors, and outside investors.

### Profitability Metrics

Profitability metrics have to do with the efficiency of the processes by which the company creates and delivers its products and services to customers. These are operational metrics, sought after by those people in the company responsible for production. Typically led in a large company by the chief operating officer.

### Risk Metrics

risk metrics have to do with tracking and where possible reducing the many potential dangers a company faces. For example, if a company is spending a large portion of its net cash flow every month on interest on its debts, then even a small drop in revenues caused by some external shock, like a recession, could cause the company to become insolvent and collapse.

## 3. Distinguishing Traditional and Dynamic Metrics

Traditional business metrics include standard financial and managerial accounting categories, such as quarterly statements of net cash flow, profits and losses, and changes to balance sheet items such as shareholder's equity.

### Dynamic Metrics

We want Dynamic Business Metrics that are defined and can be communicated in a manner that conveys urgency.

what change in our business processes can we make right now to increase revenues, maximize profitability, or reduce risk?

Two attributes make a business metric dynamic. 

First, will the metric change significantly over intervals of a month or less? If not, it's not very dynamic. 

For example, the monthly rent a stand alone retail store in a mall pays on its three-year real estate lease is of course a business metric related to its efficiency and profitability, but it is not a dynamic business metric. There's no point in tracking it because it won't change anytime soon.

On the other hand, if a national retail chain with 1,000 mall-based stores is individually negotiating and signing an average of about seven new three-year leases each week, it can and should track average monthly rent per square foot on new real estate leases as an important dynamic metric, against which to set goals and track progress. 

Second, are their specific actions the company can take that can visibly or significantly impact the metric in the short term?

If not, then the metric doesn't lend itself to dynamic tracking.

Whether the metric is dynamic, may also depend on the business context. For example, if the 1,000 store retail chain we just mentioned is neither adding nor closing stores and is simply renewing leases on current space, where the old leases had pre-negotiated terms to be extended, It will be difficult to make much impact on the average monthly rent per square foot. On the other hand, if that retail chain publicly announces that it is going to close 25% of its US retail stores, as the GAP chain did in June of 2015, it may be able to go back to landlords with the proposition, either we leave at the end of the current lease and you'll need to find a new tenant, if you can, who may not pay as much per square foot as we do. Or let's renegotiate our lease terms now. In this case, the average monthly rent per square foot for newly renegotiated leases would be a dynamic metric for the GAP. It's a place they could save money. This is why announcing all your bad news at once is often a good business strategy.

Total revenues is always an aggregate number, and as they say on the Kissmetrics website, aggregate data is kind of worthless.

 Studies have shown that pages that load in three or more seconds are much less likely to lead to sales than pages that load in less than three seconds. 40% of web users will abandon completely, a web page that does not load in three seconds. This is why there's an entire industry devoted to what's called edge caching. Content delivery networks, like Akamai, that retail stores pay to store copies of their websites locally, physically near their customers around the world, saving a precious second or two in load times.
