## 1. What is Metric?

Metrics are numbers that we can impact when we change our business processes. So, for example, for a local bricks and mortar retail clothing store rooted in the state of North Carolina. Where we have a 4.75% sales tax, the sales tax is not a metric. There's nothing that we can do to change it. It's basically a fact of nature for us like the weather.

On the other hand the percentage of people who viewed our ad on a particular website. Then used it as a link to click through to our homepage. Can change every time the ad contents and appearance change. Or when the time of day changes, where we run the ad, on what websites it appears etc.
