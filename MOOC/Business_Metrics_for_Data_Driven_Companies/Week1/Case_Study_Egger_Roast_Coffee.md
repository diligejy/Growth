### Definition

Profitable companies actually run out of cash and go out of business quite often. 

One of the most common triggers for this kind of disaster is uncontrolled or unplanned sales growth.

Too much success, too quickly can kill you.

Cash flow analysis is all about timing. You may recall that we pay for new beans COD, cash on delivery and then we need 30 more days to process the beans before they can arrive at the customer site. The customer then pays us net 60. This means that on average when we receive an order, we spend cash on that same day, but we get paid cash by the customer 90 days later.

This situation known as negative float is extremely common in all different kinds of businesses. I will point out that certain businesses, like insurance and banking get paid cash now to deliver a service later. This is a delightful situation known as positive float.
