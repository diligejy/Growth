## 1. A traditional Enterprise Sales Funnel

Enterprise sales are expensive to do and therefore the payoff for each enterprise sale must be large. Companies that attempt enterprise sales for low-priced to medium-priced items typically lose money on average on every sale and either change their sales model or go out of business. Different companies in different industries have different numbers for what would qualify as a minimum size enterprise sale, but I'll give you a general rule based on the cost of operating in the United States. I would say you would want to have a minimum of $250,000 for a one-time sale, or $100,000 per year on a recurring sale to justify an enterprise sales effort.
