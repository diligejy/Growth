## 1. What is the Pie?

- I want you to think of negotiation as more like a math problem than a tug of war. Thinking of negotiation this way allows you to be dispassionate and to better understand what's really at stake.

- Example

    - A : their own : 1
    - B : their own : 2
    - But A & B Cooperate : 9
        - Pie = 9 - 3(A & B their own) = 6
        - How can divide pie(6)?


- The more important it is to have a principle.


## 2. Problem

- Recall Abe has 60¢ and Bea has $1.00 to spend on a drink. With the money he has, Abe would buy a 6-oz. bottled water for 60¢ and Bea would buy a 16-oz. bottled water for $1.00. However, if they pool their funds, they can buy a 32-oz. bottled water for $1.60. How much water do we expect Abe will get as a result of the negotiation?

    - Note: Abe and Bea have a 7-oz. cup on hand to help divide up the water.

- Answer : 11oz

    - That’s right. The pie is 10 oz. To get that extra 10 oz., Bea needs Abe just as much as Abe needs Bea. Thus I think it should be split equally. In that case, Abe would get 6 + 5 = 11 oz. You can give yourself a bonus if you figured out how they could use the 7-oz. cup to do the division: Bea can take three cups (21 oz.), leaving Abe with the remaining 11 ounces.

    - This problem is a small stakes version of a real negotiation. Two couples were each looking for an apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts. On their own, one was looking to buy a two-bedroom apartment for $600,000, and the other was looking to buy a three-bedroom apartment for $800,000. (I've rounded the numbers.) As the two couples were friends, they considered buying a two-family home together. They soon found a house they both liked for $1.2 million. One half was two bedrooms, and the other half was three bedrooms. Everyone was happy. But they had to figure out how to split the purchase price. 

    - One option was to use the ratio of bedrooms, 3:2, or the ratio of the square footage, which was about 5:4. Another was the ratio of what would have been their separate purchases, or 4:3. After thinking about the ideas here, they agreed to split the gains evenly. Buying the two-family home created a $200,000 savings or pie. Neither couple could get this savings without the other. Thus the two-bedroom half was charged $500,000, and the three-bedroom half was charged $700,000. So, the ratio was 7:5.

    - Of course, it is hardly worth your while to negotiate over how to split trivial items such as a 32-oz. water bottle. But if you get the principle down and start seeing the world this way, you can apply this same approach when the stakes really matter.
