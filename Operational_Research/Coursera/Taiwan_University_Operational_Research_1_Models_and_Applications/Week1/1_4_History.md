## 1. Origin of linear programming

- George Dantzig (1914-2005)

    - Ph.D in Statistics, University of California, Berkeley (1946).

    - He solved two well-known difficult problems which were mistakenly considered as homework assignment.

- During World War II, he served in the United States Air Force doing route planning for military aircraft.

    - Each plan is called a "program"

- He found:

    - Many problems are linear optimization problems.

    - No one is able to systemically solve large-scale optimization problems.

- He  invented the simplex method.

    - The "first" effective solution for linear programming in the world

    - Still an important part in commercial software nowadays.
