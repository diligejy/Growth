## 1. Margins Occur Across Distribution Channel

- Manufacturer -> Distributor -> Wholesaler -> Retailer -> Customer

## 2. Calculating Margins

1. Margin = Selling Price - Cost to Produce

2. Imagine your selling price is $100.00 and your cost to produce is $75.00. What's your margin?

## 3. Variations on the Cost/Price Relationship

- Margin % = (Selling Price - Cost) / Selling Price
- Selling Price = Cost / (1 - % Margin)

## 4. Markups vs Margins

- When expressed in currency, they are exactly same.
- If percentages or decimals are used, a 20% markup (on cost) is different than a 20% margin (on price).

## 5. Calculating Markups

- Markup % = (Selling Price - Cost) / Cost
- Selling Price = Cost * (1 + Markup %)
