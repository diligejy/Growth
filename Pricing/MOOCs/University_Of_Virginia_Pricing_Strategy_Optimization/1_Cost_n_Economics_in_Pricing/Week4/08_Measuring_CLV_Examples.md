## 1. Example of CLV (1)

- Customer pays $10 per year for a subscription to an online service

- Servicing this customer costs $5 per year

- Customers have to sign up for one year and the contract is renewed yearly

- The appropriate discount rate is 10%

- Company data show that only 30% of customers who sign up stay an additional year, but of those who stay 2 years 80% stay a third year

## 2. 3-Year CLV

- $5 + .3 ($5/1.1) + (.8 * .3) * ($5/1.1^2) = $7.35

## 3. Example of CLV (2)

- Customer pays $15 per year for a subscription to an online service, which will reduce their initial customer base by 20%

- Servicing this customer costs $5 per year

- Customers have to sign up for one year and the contract is renewed yearly

- The appropriate discount rate is 10%

- Company data show that only 20% of customers who sign up stay an additional year, but of those who stay 2 years 50% stay a third year

## 4. 3-Year CLV

- $10 + .2 * ($10/1.1) + (.5 * .2) * ($10/1.1^2) = $12.63

- Remember, the customer base was reduced by 20%, so only 80% of customers who would buy at $10 per year will buy at $15 per year

- To account for this, multiply $12.63 by 80%, which is $10.10

- Comparing this to the $7.35, we got from charging $10, we see that the price increase is worth it!
