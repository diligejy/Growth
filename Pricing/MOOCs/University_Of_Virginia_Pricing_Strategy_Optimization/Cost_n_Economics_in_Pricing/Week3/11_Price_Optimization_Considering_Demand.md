## 1. The Primitives of Pricing

Q = 10 - 2P

## 2. Using Demand Information

- $\pi = (P - MC)Q$

- $\pi = (P - MC)(10-2P)$

- $\pi = 10P - 2P^2 - 10MC + 2MCP$

- 10-4P + 2MC = 0 

- P* = 10/4 + MC/2 = 2.5 + 1/2 = 3
- Q* = 10 - 2 (3) = 4
- Profit = 4 * (3 - 1) = 8

## 3. Why is this harder in the real world?

- No one gives you demand
- You might sell through someone who has their incentives
- Some things are illegal.

## 4. How do we get demand?

- Surveys (Zero Junk Mail)
- Conjoint Analysis (Portland Trailblazers)
- Purchase Data
    - Scanner Data (Beef Sales)
    - Panel Data

- Almost all CPG firm subscribe to scanner data services
