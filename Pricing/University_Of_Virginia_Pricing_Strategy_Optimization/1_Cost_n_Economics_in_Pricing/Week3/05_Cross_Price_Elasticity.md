## 1. Cross-Price Elasticity

- Cross-price elasticity is defined as %dQ/%dP
- E_c = dQ/dP. * P./Q

- So E_c = -53.63 * P./Q (use the means)
- E = -53.63 * (1.695/107.55) = -.84
- The negative sign indicates that these products are complements (not substitutes)
- A 10% increase in the price of chicken will decrease our demand by about 8.4%

## 2. Understandidng Competitive Structure

<img src="/Img/05_Cross_Price_Elasticity_2.jpg">

- Which brand is most sensitive to its own price?
- Who is Crest's main competitor?
- Can underlying preferences be detected?
    - We would expect asymmectric cross-price elasticities between Audi and VW.
