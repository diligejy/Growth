    - Cleaning cost
    - Wash towels/linens
    - Energy consumption for A/C, TV, etc

- Marginal Cost Pricing
    - Selling price $48 = Marginal Cost $40 + Markup% 20%

## 3. When is marginal cost pricing used?

- To add to revenue and profit... especially when business is slow
- To get a "foot in the door": entering a market or creating opportunities for cross-selling
