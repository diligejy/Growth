## 6. The Idea for a Super Economy Car

- Set price at $2,500

- Forego features
    - AC, Power Steering, Power Windows, Tachometer, Dual Windshield Wipers

- Streamline design
    - Modular components produced at different sites for local manufacture
    - Components serve more than one function

## 7. The result? The Tata Nano!

## 8. So, What happened?

- Couldn't quite hit the target price point

- Mismatched advertising (online, flashy showrooms) and their audience (markets, shops, bazaars)

- Sales were less than stellar
    - Launched in Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and Nepal with similar results
    - As of Jan 2015, sales limited to ~ 1,300 units/month

## 9. Takeaways from Tata's Experience with the Nano

- Low price point innovation is only the beginning

- Go-to-Market has its own challenges
    - Perception of cheap vs aspiration
    - Support systems - financing, dealers, maintenance

- Need to innovate on all four pillars of the marketing mix (product, price, place, promotion)
