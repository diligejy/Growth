## 2. Quantify value drivers to find the indifference price point

1. Indifference price
    - Price at which Jane would be indifferent whether she buys our product or her next best alternative

## 3. Use the indifference price point to set the price

- Justifiable price range
    - Range above product cost and indifference price
