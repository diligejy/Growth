## 1. Example 2 - Attribute Trade-offs

- Currently Considered Model
    - Magnum Force = .43
    - 10 yeards further = .12
    - $6.99 per pack = .22

    - Total Utility = .77


- Would the average golfer rather have a ball that drives an additional 5 yards (15 yards further) or a price reduction to $4.99 per pack?
    - Answer : -.70 - .22 = .48 > .36 - .12 = .24
    - So, the answer is decrease in price
