### 1. Demand Curves Without Elasticity

- Need to estimate three points on product's demand curve
    - Lowest price we'd consider charging, and demand at that price
    - Highest price we'd consider charging, and demand at that price
    - Median price, and demand at that price

- Excel can fit basic quadratic demand equation to our three price/demand points:

    - $d = a(p)^2 + b(p) + c$

    - d : demand
    - p : price
    - a, b and c : auto-calculated for us by Excel to give best fit

- Quadratic curve adjusts to fit all three demand/price points
- Reasonable assumption : curve that fits our three points approximates demand between the points
- Excel's Solver can be used against demand curve to determine optimal price.

### 2. Example

- We've just acquired a new product, and need to evaluate pricing ASAP
- Could make high/median/low guesses about demand 
- Running Small Experiment instead:
    - 3 CVS stores around Harvard Square
    - Shoppers randomly choose store
    - Stores have equivalent sales

- Pricing : $1.50, $2.49, $3.29
- Unit Sales: 93, 72, 18
