### 1. Optimizing Price

- Best price - price that yields max profits, not necessarily max unit sales
- Excel's Solver tool can be used to construct useful pricing models

### 2. Excel Solver

- Solver tries all reasonable solutions that fit the specified model.
- Chooses optimal solution - values for variable cells thhat produce best value for target cell

### 3. Pricing Optimization Example

- Find Best price for ink jet printer

    - Current Price : $75
    - Demand at current price : 5,000 printers
    - Cost to Produce one printer : $59
    - Price Elasticity : 2.0
    - Linear demand curve

- Two known points on demand curve:
    - (p = $75, d = 5,000)
    - (p = $75.75, d=4,900)

### 4. Pricing Optimization w/Tie-In Product

- Including profits from tie-in products lower optimum price for original product

- Assumption for our example
    - Average printer lifetime: 3 years
    - Ink cartridge lifetime: 6 months
    - Ink cartridges sold per printer: 6 (2/yr * 3 yrs)
    - Ink cartridges must be priced at $34
    - Profit per ink cartridge sold in $12
