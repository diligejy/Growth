## 1. Measures of sample central tendency

- central tendency statistics give us a summary of where our data is on the number line.

- Frequently used central tendency statistics:

    - sample mean :

        - $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum x_i}{n} $

    - sample median : The middle value after sorting the data (or average of the middle two values).

        - $\widetilde{x}	$

    - sample mode : Most frequent observed value.
