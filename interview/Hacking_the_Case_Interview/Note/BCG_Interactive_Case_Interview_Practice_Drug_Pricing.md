### 1. DRUG CASE OVERVIEW

Today, we are going to discuss the case of a pharmaceutical company based in the U.S. 
The Client has developed a new drug, PrevneT (Prevent Thormbosis), that helps reduce the rate at which a particular complication of hip-replacement surgery, deep-vein thorombosis (DVT) occurs.

What you need to know is that DVT can lead to very serious medical conditions, including higher risk of pulmonary embolism (PE) or major bleeding.

PrevenT will directly complete against Clearvenax, an established product that is also used to reduce rates of DVT and hence DVT-related complications. Clearvenax is sold at $4 per dose and has a variable production cost of $1 per dose. The client has asked you to help set a suitable price for PrevenT.
