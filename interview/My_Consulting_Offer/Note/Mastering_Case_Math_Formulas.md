## 1. Profit

- The goal is to figure out how much profit a company is currently making and how to increase their profit.

- Profit is the amount of money left over after a company has paid all its expenses and collected its revenue. It's typically calculated over a set period, such as a quarter or a year. 

- The formula is: Profit = Revenue - Cost

- There are two main ways for companies to increase their profits:

    - bringing in more revenue
    - cost cutting


- In the case of SweetCo, their profits have gone down in the last 5 years. To figure out why, we'd need to take a closer look at both their revenues and their costs and see which one is driving the problem.

- Revenue
    - Revenue, also known as sales, is the total amount of money a company receives from selling its products or services.

    - It's always measured in terms of currency, such as U.S. dollars or European euros.

    - To calculate revenue, you'll need to know the volume of products sold and the price at which they are sold.

    - Depending on what data you have, you can use the formula:

        - Revenue = Volume X Price

- Cost
    - There are 2 types of costs: fixed and variable costs.

    - Fixed costs are expenses that do not change regardless of how much product or service is produced.

    - Examples of SweetCo's fixed costs include: rent and management salaries
    
    - These costs do not change if SweetCo increases its candy production. (unless it needs a whole new factory)

    - On the other hand, variable costs are expenses that increase with higher sales or production.
    
    - For SweetCo, these could include costs of sugar, flavoring, and production labor.

    - To calculate the total cost, you add all costs together:
        - Total Cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs


## 2. Profit Margin

- Profit margin is a metric used to measure how much profit the company makes as a percentage of its revenue: Profit Margin = Profit / Revenue

- it helps them determine their pricing strategies and evaluate their financial health.

- For SweetCo, if their profit margin decreased from 25% to 15% over the last 5 years, 

- it indicates that the company is not operating as efficiently as it could be or that competition in their market is getting more intense.

- The profit margin is a useful tool to identify areas where the company could potentially improve its profitability.

- There are 3 types of profit margins:

    - Net profit margin
        - Measures the company's overall profitability after all expenses, including taxes and interest, have been deducted from the revenue.

        - This is the most common profit margin case interview formula you will use.

    - Gross profit margin

        - Gives an idea of the profitability of the company's core operations.

        - It only considers the revenue and the cost of goods sold, which are the expenses incurred to produce the company's product or service.

    - Operating profit margin

        - takes it one step further from the gross profit margin

        - It also takes into account other operating expenses, such as rent, utilities, etc. It excludes taxes and interest expenses.

    - Each of these types of profit margins provides a different perspective on a company's financial performance.

    - For example, if SweetCo's gross profit margin is decreasing more than the operating profit margin, it may indicate that the costs of candy ingredients are driving the overall profitability problem, rather than fixed costs.


## 3. BreakEven

- Breakeven, also known as the payback period, is a financial metric that helps companies determine how long it would take to recover their initial investment in a new project or purchase.

- It is ususally measure in years and is calculated by
    
    - Breakeven = Initial Investment / Annual Profit

- For example, let's say SweetCo is considering expanding into the chocolate market and building a new factory that costs $2 million.

- This factory is projected to generate an additional $250,000 in annual profit.

- Using the breakeven formula, we can calculate that it would take SweetCo 8 years to recoup its initial investment.

- It's important to note that breakeven analysis should not be the only factor considered when making business decisions.

- Other factors, such as market competition and potential future growth, should also be considered.


## 4. Return on Investment 

- A related concept to breakeven is the return on investment (ROI). This metric helps companies measure their investment's effectiveness in generating additional profit.

- Return on investment helps businesses determine whether or not an investment is worth the resources or to choose between alternative investments.

- A higher ROI means a better return on the investment, while a lower ROI means less profit generated relative to the investment cost.

- SweetCo is considering investing $500,000 in a new packaging machine for their gummy candies

- The machine will help reduce costs and increase efficiency.

- The expected annual savings from this investment is $75,000

- We would use the case interview formula:

    - Return on Investment = (Profit from Investment / Investment Cost) * 100%

- This means that for every dollar SweetCo invests in the new packaging machine, they can expect to earn an additional 15 cents in profit.

- This ROI calculation can help SweetCo determine whether the new machine is worth pursuing, or if they should invest in something else.

## 5. Market Share

- Market share is the percentage of the total sales in a specific market the company makes

- This metric can vary from 0%, which means the company has no presense in the market, to 100%, which signifies the company has complete dominance in the market.

- Calculating market share can also provide insights into potential challenges and opportunities for a company within a market.

- For example, if the company already has a high market share, it suggests there is limited room to grow in that market.

- Factors that impact market share include brand recognition, distribution, and pricing strategy.

- Company's Market Share = Comapny's Revenue in the Market / Total Market Share

- For example, if the chocolate market is worth $150 million and SweetCo believes it can generate $15 million in revenue, its market share would be 10%.


## 6. Growth

- Growth rate tells us how much a company's revenue (or other metric ) has increased or decreased over a period of time.

- We calculate it by comparing the current year's revenue to the previous year's The formula is: Growth Rate = (New - Old) / Old

- For example, let's say SweetCo had $100 million in revenue this year and $120 million in revenue last year.
